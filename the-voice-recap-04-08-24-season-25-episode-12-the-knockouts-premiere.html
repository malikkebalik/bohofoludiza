The coaches were looking for the artists at the top of their game. The ones that showed consistency and their best. They were always higher notes they can reach. They were going into the Playoffs after this.</p><p>Meaning now was not the time to play it safe. Keith Urban was acting as the mega mentor tonight. He first assisted Reba because her team was up first. She paired off Tae Lewis against Asher Havon. They were both Soul. One was Country Soul and the other was R&B Soul. They were both powerhouses. They even chose a song that they knew they could connect with.</p><p>Asher chose “Unbreak My Heart” by Toni Braxton. He just went through a breakup. He hasn’t really dealt with it because he’s been on the show and so his music was a chance for him to finally process those emotions. Asher wanted to show off his skillset, but the coaches actually advised him to be still. To live in the moment. To let the emotion carry the day. Asher tone back the runs. He sung from the heart and his later performance was beautiful. He went up first. He had raised his hand earlier. And Tae had to follow a tough one.</p><p>Tae chose “Nothin’ on You” by Cody Johnson. It was about the love that the artist had for his wife. Tae performed the song as someone that wants to fall in love one day. He wants to meets the one and get married. He grew up in the church. His father is a pastor. His father told him to connect with everyone in the audience with his voice and he did that with his performance. He brought the room together. Only there was a clear winner. It was Asher. Asher had the coaches on their feet because they all wanted to Steal him at the first chance they got. Reba had to pick Asher because she wanted to win.</p><p>All the other coaches tried to use their Steal on Tae. He was that good. Tae ultimately chose to go with Dan + Shay. Dan + Shay were the next team up. They paired Frank Garcia with Olivia Rubini. They both have an old timey vibe to them. They both were so unique in their own way. It was a great Knockout. Frank chose the song “El Triste” by Jose Jose. He first performed this song on another singing show. He got bullied online for it because a lot of people were calling him feminine. He wasn’t out back then and so he wanted to go back to the song because he wanted people to see the real him. The proud LGBT+ boy that owns his femininity.</p><p>Olivia chose the song “Tiny Dancer” by Elton John. Both she and Frank needed coaching. Frank needed to put more emotion into his music. He needed to just let go. Olivia was the opposite. She tried to go big and it wasn’t for her. Olivia gave herself the tougher song because she wanted to rise to the challenge only Elton was a tough act to replicate. Both Olivia and Frank had great moments. Not so great moments. They were both equally talented and so the coaches were split on who won. Dan+ Shay named Olivia as the winner because they felt she came out a little ahead.</p><p>Next up was Team John. John paired Val T. Webb against Nathan Chester. They were both powerhouses. Nathan was up first with his selection. He chose “Fooled Around And Fell In Love” by Elvin Bishop. He picked it because it played in a movie he watched with his late grandfather. He still thinks of his grandfather whenever he hears that song and it helps that he now knows the emotion going into it. He fell in love with his girlfriend. She was the great love of his life. He felt he could tackle this song now. And he wasn’t wrong.</p><p>Val had the same idea with her choice. She chose “Sweet Love” by Anita Baker. She thinks of her husband whenever she hears that song. They were both musicians. He understood that she has to pursue her dream because he has a dream of his own. Val also tackled this song because she has the talent to back it up. Anita was hard to perform for a reason. She was one of the OG Divas. Val was able to match her with her own voice. She did have some pitch issues at the start and she worked through them.</p><p>Both Val and Nathan had a great performance. The coaches were split on who won. It made things tougher for John. He went with Nathan because his performance stood out more for John. John was ready to hear Nathan’s whole album after his performance and the coaches agreed with his assessment. Next up was Team Chance. Chance paired Dani Stacy with Serenity Arce. They were both four chair turns. They were both in the Pop Genre. They were going to kill it and Chance knew they’d bring out the best in each other.</p><p>Dani went first with her choice. She chose “Jaded” by Miley Cyrus. It was a great song choice because it matches her tone, but Keith felt it sounded too much like Miley’s rendition. He wanted to hear more Dani. Serenity chose “Unfaithful” by Rihanna. She knows how to put raw emotion into her song. Even when it’s about an unfaithful partner. Something she has no experience with. She still gave it her all and so she was asked to pull back some. Or Reba would say “be still”. Both young women had good performances and they stood out in their own way.</p><p>Dani chose her song because it was her best friend’s favorite song. Her friend died and so she was singing in tribute. Serenity meanwhile may not know the emotion going into the song. She chose someone she wishes to aspire to. She loves Rihanna. She wants to be in the field between R&B and Pop. Neither of the young women pulled off a perfect performance. They were issues with both of them. Chance chose to go with Serenity because he felt she had the passion to keep going and he wasn’t entirely sure that Dani did.</p><p>Reba’s team was up again. She paired Ashley Bryant against Josh Sanders. They were both in the Country lane. Ashley was Country Pop. Josh was more Country Rock. Ashley was initially up first. She chose “Heads Carolina, Tails California” by Jo Dee Messina. She loved listening to this song with her grandmother. Ashley’s anxiety got to her during rehearsals and so she was advised to get out of her own head for a bit. She’s used to being on twenty-four seven. She needed to give herself a breather. Which could explain why Josh later performed before she did.</p><p>Normally, they don’t switch things up from rehearsals. They did this time. Josh went first. He chose “Wild As Her” by Corey Kent. He was the father of four girls. He loved the energy they have whenever they hear this song and so he wanted to perform it because he wanted to inspire them to be whatever they desire to be. He gave a very full performance. He was later named the winner because he had the confidence to back up his performance. Ashley was still learning. She really needed to get out of her own head now because its costing her opportunities.</p><p>Next up was Team Dan + Shay. They paired Anya True with Kyle Schuesler. Anya was up first. She chose “Runaway” by Aurora because she really connects to it. She was still getting used to living apart from her sister. Her sister was at college. They talk constantly on the phone only it wasn’t enough. Her sister was home. Anya also took a risk tonight because she decided to put away her guitar. She wanted to focus on the voice because that’s the literal name of the show. And she proved she could center herself if she’s feeling like she’s losing herself to the music.</p><p>Kyle performed second. He chose “Say You Won’t Let Go” by James McArthur. It reminded him of his late grandmother. He was in that mindset after her death and now singing it helps him with his grief. He tried to play his with his guitar. The coaches actually told him to put the guitar away. He was using it as a crutch rather than that of enhancement. They want to see his stage presence when honestly there wasn’t much of that. He was glued to the mike. He didn’t dance or move around. He stayed put and to be fair so did Anya.</p><p>Dan + Shay later named Anya as the last winner of the night. Chance then jumped to add Kyle to his team using his STEAL. It was made even funnier because Chance convinced Dan + Shay to go with Anya so that he could use his steal. And its just one giant manipulation.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1npJ2ybsLOopqeZaKasKK8jGlrZmhoYn91edKemKynnmJ%2FdnnEqaCsp5SaenJ%2BjK2fnmWbo7ykt86uq6xloKeyrrXEq5xo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-sydney-powell-and-what-did-she-do.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Sydney Powell and what did she do?</a>

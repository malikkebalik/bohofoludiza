He was born in Chicago, and lived with his parents and his younger brother, Wood. Harris’s father was a bus driver, and his mother was a housewife. Although her sons were gifted athletes, Mattie Harris always made sure they put their education before sports.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_56>Harris attended a private high school, St. Joseph High, in Westchester, Illinois. The high school was actually featured in the 1994 film, Hoop Dreams. St. Joseph was known for turning out star athletes, and Harris was no exception. He played running back for the high school football team, and later played linebacker for Northern Illinois University.</p><p id=par-5_43>Unfortunately, Harris’s football career was cut short after a serious injury to the ligament in his ankle. He graduated from Northern Illinois University with a bachelor’s degree in Drama. He then attended the University of Delaware and received a master’s degree in Theater.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-his-television-and-film-career-spans-30-years>His television and film career spans 30 years</h2><p id=par-6_56><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harris</a> has been working on both the big and small screens for more than 30 years now. He is most well-known for his role as Eugene Young on the legal drama, The Practice. He was one of only three actors (along with Michael Badalucco and Camryn Manheim) to appear on all eights seasons of the series.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_34>His other television credits include appearances in Grey’s Anatomy, New York Undercover, Law & Order, and Heist. He also played a drug enforcer named Roscoe in the fifth season of the popular series, Justified.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_63>Harris has also appeared in several films. His role as a philandering, heartless husband in Diary of a Mad Black Woman showcased his incredible talent. Harris displays the wide range in his acting ability in a number of different films, including The Rock, The Mod Squad, Quarantine, and Bringing Down the House. He also did voice work for the animated series, The Batman.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-his-net-worth-and-what-is-he-doing-now>What is his net worth and what is he doing now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_67>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Harris net worth is about $500,000. He recently worked on the series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Filthy Rich,</a> which was canceled after just one season. The series centers around the ultra-wealthy Monreauxes, a Southern family that created a Christian television network. After the father of the family passes away, his wife learns that he had three other children who are now heirs to the family fortune.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_67>Harris also appeared in a recent episode of Jordan Peele’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Twilight Zone </a>reboot. The episode, titled “Replay”, was about a woman who tried to turn back time to prevent her son from being killed by a racist police officer. Like Rod Serling, Peele used the episode to highlight a current problem in society–namely, racial targeting by police officers. Harris played Uncle Neil, the main character’s brother.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_69>Aside from acting, Harris enjoys spending time with his family. He and his brother, Wood, are very close. They actually started an online show called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">StevexWood</a>, which covered all things pop culture. The brothers would discuss all aspects of entertainment, from sports to music to movies. They seem to have taken a break from the show, however, as we haven’t seen any new posts in more than two years.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtbHVnmShmaKntrR5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpesetpKVn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bobcat-mt52-specs-prices-2022.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bobcat MT52 Specs &amp;amp; Prices 2022</a>

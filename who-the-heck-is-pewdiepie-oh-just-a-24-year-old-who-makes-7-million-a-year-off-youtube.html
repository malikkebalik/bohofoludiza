His current <strong>net worth is $12 million </strong>and he is on pace to earn &nbsp;between $4 and $7 million dollars this year from his Youtube channel. That makes him the&nbsp;most successful YouTube star in the world, by a long shot.&nbsp; So what's so special about <a href=#>PewDiePie</a>?&nbsp; Read on…</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194149 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/GettyImages-169351487.jpg alt=PewDiePie width=682 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194149 class=wp-caption-text>PewDiePie / ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images</p><p class=p1></p><p class=p1>Felix Kjellberg was born Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg in Gotenburg, Sweden on the 24th of October in 1989.&nbsp; After graduating from high school, he went on to attend Chalmers University of Technology, where he majored in Industrial Economics and Technology.&nbsp; An avid gamer, he spent more time focused on making it to the next level in his favorite games than on making it to sophomore year.&nbsp; In 2010, he decided to launch his own YouTube Channel about gaming.&nbsp; His idea was simple – he'd review the games he was playing, by filming himself playing the games so that viewers could gauge for themselves whether the game was genuinely entertaining.&nbsp; His tendency to yell at the screen, jump around, occasionally call out obscenities, and to hold nothing back, made him required viewing for teenage gamers, very quickly.&nbsp; Unlike many other gaming channels, which focus on the games themselves, Kjellberg has always been more interested in giving his viewers the experience of playing the games.&nbsp; He cares little about production values, so every video has a distinctly home-made feel, and he does all of his own editing.&nbsp; He calls his viewers, "Bros", and does a "Brofist" to conclude each show.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194148 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/GettyImages-494848206.jpg alt=PewDiePie width=900 height=632 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194148 class=wp-caption-text>PewDiePie / John Lamparski/Getty Images</p><p class=p1>Not only has his personality made him popular, but his choice of games has earned him a strong following among the video game developing community.&nbsp; He tends to review independent titles, primarily action and horror.&nbsp; Some smaller design firms have started subtly shifting their game design, so that the games are not only fun to play, but also fun to watch friends play.&nbsp; His channel eventually became so popular, that he dropped out of college in 2011.&nbsp; He wasn't making quite enough to live on yet, though, so he sold hot dogs to pick up the slack.&nbsp; In 2012, <strong>Maker Studios</strong> caught wind of his successful channel, and offered to sign him.&nbsp; He quickly became the company's most popular online personality.&nbsp; The scope of his popularity and influence became especially apparent in late 2013.&nbsp; By November 2013, his channel on YouTube had <strong>15 million subscribers</strong>.&nbsp; That number mushroomed to <strong>19 million subscribers</strong> just a month later. Between June of 2013 and December of 2013, his videos were viewed 1.3 billion times. &nbsp;Today PewDiePie has 32 million subscribers and his videos have been viewed a mind-boggling 7 billion times. Earlier this year, Maker Studios was purchased by the <strong><a href=# title="Walt Disney Net Worth">Walt Disney</a> Co</strong> for <strong>$500 million dollars</strong>. One of the main reasons Disney was interested in Maker Studios is their relationship with PewDiePie. &nbsp;This is PewDiePie's most popular video as of this writing. It was posted roughly one year ago and has 54 million views:</p><p class=p1>The 24-year old seems rather uncomfortable with his popularity, though he does take the time to greet his fans personally whenever he goes to gaming events.&nbsp; He rarely grants interviews, and sometimes wishes that he had less influence.&nbsp; He says, "I'm so central to YouTube now, and that puts me in the spotlight and raises a lot of questions like, "Why is he so big? I'd much prefer to have something like 5 million subscribers."&nbsp; It's a strange problem to have.&nbsp; He has made a point of becoming involved in various charity drives, and has surpassed his goal amount each time.&nbsp; To date, he and his fans have raised over a <strong>$1 million for charity</strong>.&nbsp; Now living in a nice apartment in London with his girlfriend, the shy college dropout continues to earn subscribers and die-hard fans.&nbsp; Of late, he has expressed some weariness at making video after video, and he has announced plans to slow down over the course of the next few years.&nbsp; Whether that will affect his subscriber base, and his wallet, remains to be seen.</p><p class=p2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJorqGZpKh6c4CMspyaql2kuaV50rCcnZ1dnLy1ecOopa1loKS9trjAq2ScoJGju6a4jLKmrqyll7Jw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alec-baldwin-reaches-settlement-with-family-of-halyna-hutchins.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alec Baldwin Reaches Settlement With Family Of Halyna Hutchins</a>

In 2023, he was named the starting pitcher for the All-Star Games of the National League.</span></p><h2><b>Zac Gallen Bio, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Parents, Net Worth</b></h2><p><span>Gallen was born on 3rd August 1995 in Somerdale, New Jersey, to his loving and caring parents, Jim and Stacy Gallen. When he was five years old, he declined the decision to play in the tee-ball team with his peers. Instead, he demanded to play Little League Baseball with the Somerdale team.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, he was taken by his father’s team to the third round of the Little League draft. It was decided that he would now play with children between seven and nine years old. </span><span>After that, at 11, Gallen joined the Tri-state Arsenal Baseball Academy, where he started playing as a pitcher and second baseman.</span></p><p><span>Then, he joined Bishop Eustace Preparatory School in Pennsauken Township and the University of North Carolina. </span>At the University of North Carolina, he played baseball continuously for three years.

Presently, she is working as an accounts executive. She seems to be there, cheerleading for Zac or when Zac is playing on the field. She has posted lots of pictures on Instagram @</span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>eliseloughran</span></a><span>, where she has 3,941 followers and 794 following members with only 50 posts.</span></p><h4><b>Social Media</b></h4><p><span>Zac is available on Instagram with a verified name – </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>zac_gallen</span></a><span>, and 37.4K followers. On </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>6th May 2023</span></a><span>, Zac Gallen wished Elise Loughran “Happy birthday” with a long message and a few adorable words, including “…I Love You mucho!…”&nbsp;</span><span>He has also posted </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>a picture</span></a><span> of two ladies sitting on a restaurant table. One of those ladies is tagged with the name – </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>alyssa_cunningham</span></a><span>. He gave the caption to that picture, “Family.”</span></p><h3><b>Zac Gallen Net Worth</b></h3><p>Zac signed a $5.6 million, one-year contract, that benefits the Diamondbacks by locking him in before he hits free agency. The team, with ample funds, sees this move as ideal. Arizona, a big media market, aims to secure Gallen’s services before he commands a massive pitcher’s contract.</p><p>His value will likely rise if he stays healthy, contributing to the team’s advantage. As he remains far from free agency, Gallen’s potential for growth is considerable. This move secures him before potentially demanding a top-tier pitcher’s salary.</p><h3><b>Trivia</b></h3><ul><li aria-level=1><span>Zac Gallen also won the NL Player of the Week award from 29th August to 4th September 2022.</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>The same year, he was honored with the NL Pitcher of the Month award for August.</span></li></ul><span class=simplesocialtxt>Facebook</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Twitter</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Reddit</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>WhatsApp</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Pinterest</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZa5tbTYrKeyZpOkunDGwJxkoJmcobKvew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bryson-dechambeau-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bryson DeChambeau Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>

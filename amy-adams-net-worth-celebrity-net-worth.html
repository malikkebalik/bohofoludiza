id=what-amy-adams8217-net-worth><strong>What is Amy Adams' net worth and salary?</strong></h2><p>Amy Adams is an Italian-born American actress who has a net worth of $60 million. Amy Adams is known for appearing in both films and televisions series. Some of her most-notable projects include "Enchanted," "Arrival," "American Hustle," "The Fighter," "The Master," "Vice" and "Sharp Objects." In a handful of recent years Amy has ranked among the highest-paid actresses in the world with annual earnings that can top $10-20 million.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Amy Adams was born on August 20, 1974 in Vicenza, Veneto, Italy. Her dad was in the Army at the time of her birth and had recently moved the whole family to Italy. They were stationed at the Caserma Ederle military complex. The family moved to Castle Rock, Colorado when Amy was eight years old. After her dad left the Army, he sang professionally in nightclubs. Adams has described some of her fondest childhood memories as going to her father's shows and drinking Shirley Temples at the bar. The family of nine loved to camp and hike together and perform amateur skits written by their parents. She was raised for a while in the Mormon church but the family stopped attending after her parents got divorced in 1995. Amy sang choir when she attended Douglas County High School and trained as a ballet dancer during her free time. After graduation, she and her mother moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and Amy opted out of attending college. To support herself, she worked as a greeter at a Gap store as well as a waitress.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Adams got her start in the entertainment industry in the mid '90s by performing in dinner theater all across the country before landing a series of small parts in television and in films. She worked as a dancer, but the job required her to first wait tables before getting up on stage to perform. She landed a job at the Minneapolis-based Chanhassen Dinner Theater where she performed for the next three years. Adams has described the job as very grueling and she suffered many injuries over her years at the theater. While she was at Chanhassen, she acted in her first film, "The Chromium Hook." In 1999, she was cast in a supporting role in "Drop Dead Gorgeous" starring <a href=# title="Kirsten Dunst Net Worth">Kirsten Dunst</a> and <a href=# title="Kirstie Alley Net Worth">Kirstie Alley</a>. Encouragement from her co-star Alley prompted Adams to move to Los Angeles to start a film career. She found the adjustment to Los Angeles difficult and often longed for her life back in Minnesota during her first days after the move.</p><p>Amy's first assignment came her way shortly in the form of a Fox TV series called "Manchester Prep," a spin-off from the popular film "Cruel Intentions." However, following several script revisions and two production shutdowns, the series was ultimately canceled. The three filmed episodes were released later as "Cruel Intentions 2." From 2000 to 2002, Amy appeared in guest roles on several television series including "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "The West Wing," and "That '70s Show."</p><p>Her film roles were mostly B movies until she landed the high-profile part of <a href=# title="Brenda Strong Net Worth">Brenda Strong</a> in <a href=# title="Steven Spielberg Net Worth">Steven Spielberg</a>'s 2002 film "Catch Me If You Can". The film was successful and she drew modest praise for her role, but it failed to boost her career and she was unemployed for a year after its release, nearly prompting her to quit acting. She enrolled in acting classes and received a lucrative offer to star in CBS's "Dr. Vegas", but she was dropped after just a few episodes.</p><h2 id=breakthrough><strong>Breakthrough</strong></h2><p>Adams began filming the independent comedy "Junebug" in 2005. Directed by Phil Morrison, the film premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where Adams won a special jury prize.

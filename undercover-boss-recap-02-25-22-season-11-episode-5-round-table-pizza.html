Can he withstand a hot slice of reality when front-line employees reveal where improvements could be made? ”</p><p>The show airs tonight between&nbsp;8 PM – 9 PM ET on CBS so make sure to come back for our Undercover Boss recap.&nbsp;While you wait for our recap make sure to check out all our Undercover Boss news, spoilers,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">videos, photos, recaps & more, right here!</a></p><p><strong>Tonight’s Undercover Boss recap begins now – Refresh Page often to get the&nbsp;most current updates!</strong></p><p>The most devastating economic crisis in history has been tough on business. It’s been even tougher on employees. But the President and CEO of Round Table Pizza joined “Undercover Boss” because he wanted to turn around his business and he knew for a fact the show would help. This wasn’t the first time that Paul Damico has done the show. He did it once before when he ran a different restaurant franchise. It helped then and he wants it to continue helping him now. The show gives Paul a great chance of solving problems on the ground. He was new to the company. He joined once he realized the sheer history of Round Table Pizza and how it was started in 1959 by a small Italian family and it connected Paul to his Italian roots.</p><p>But being the CEO of a company is very different compared to being on the ground level. Paul thought he was ready for it and it turns out he wasn’t. His first task as an undercover hipster named JJ was to join a small branch in California where he was put on the cut and box line. Enjoying pizza was nothing like the speedrunners needed for the job. Paul worked alongside Steve. Steve tried his best to teach Paul all that he knows and it still wasn’t helpful because Paul ended up throwing away several pizzas that got burned because of his incompetency. It was a waste of product. It also would have come out of his paycheck if he truly relied on it.</p><p>Paul also got to deliver the pizzas. The delivery service was a new thing for the company. They haven’t been doing it long. The branch that Paul first joined was great at deliveries and this too was something that Paul failed at. Paul wasn’t personable. He didn’t know how to work for that tip and so once again Steve stepped in to tell him where he was going wrong. Working together, they got the job done. They also got to know each other on a personal level. Paul found out that Steve was kicked out of the house for what seemed like no apparent reason when he was sixteen and that he was homeless for a while before he eventually got back on his feet.</p><p>Steve found a great career in Round Table Pizza. He was good at the job. He was also understanding of rookie mistakes and he wasn’t afraid to step in to help. It sucks that he got hurt in his past. But he’s doing better now and he knows how to improve the company. It seems the way that up until a few years ago the company was doing its best to listen to managers on the group and unfortunately that all changed once they started to go corporate. Steve felt less heard. He told Paul as much and Paul wants to turn that around the moment he gets back into the office. Paul went from there to another store.</p><p>He joined Patrick who was another store manager. Only Patrick has a steeper hill to climb. His store was woefully outdated. It doesn’t look like it’s been updated since the 90s. It also doesn’t look like a pizzeria what with all the western theme crap running through the place and so that’s why they haven’t been doing well. They were one of the businesses struggling in the pandemic. They’ve had to let over half of the staff go. They were running on a skeleton crew and people like Patrick who was technically a manager found themselves having to work seven days a week just to keep the lights on in the place.</p><p>Patrick’s father had just finished chemo when the pandemic occurred. Patrick couldn’t see him because he couldn’t put his dad’s fragile health at risk and so his father has had to go a year with basically being on his own. He naturally became lonely. Patrick also felt the loneliness. But as bad as Patrick’s branch has, it wasn’t a failing on corporate. That was what happened to Anthony’s restaurant. Anthony operated a branch in Dallas. It was a new market and he had to go door to door to drum up business. The restaurant was newly updated. It even had a bar and TVs. It just lacked people. The branch needed marketing support that only corporate could provide.</p><p>Then there was Laudallina. She was an amazing manager as well and she showed Paul the worst job in this business. It was cleaning the grease trap. Just the smell alone was able to turn Paul’s stomach. He hated the job, but he came to respect Laud and the tremendous support that she offers her team. At the end of his experience with this show, Paul gave each and every manager thousand of dollars in funds. It went towards their youth league as well as some much-needed renovations. As was the case for Patrick. And the branches now knew that there was a President and CEO willing to listen to them no matter what.</p><p>THE END</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnpaOxpr7CqK2eql2XvLS%2FjKucnJmgYn1zeZFuZGtqXaiyor%2FOp2RqaV2avaq%2Fzp2cZm1dp7y2usNmq5qanJp6sbXZs5ho</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ashley-roberts-assault-and-robbery-charges-trial-and-verdict.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ashley Roberts Assault And Robbery Charges, Trial And Verdict</a>

When he was born, his father was on the run from police for dealing crack cocaine and heroin and living in Detroit, Michigan.

In 1989, Mane and his mother moved to Atlanta. He grew up in an area high in crime. Mane became a drug dealer while in junior high. He used his Christmas money in eighth grade to buy crack cocaine to sell to others.</p><p>Mane was a good student in high school and popular with his peers. Despite having a side hustle as a drug dealer, Mane didn't take drugs for the first few years he was dealing. In 1995, Mane had been selling drugs for two years when someone stopped him on his bicycle and pointed a gun at his head and robbed him. After this, he began carrying a handgun. Mane graduated from high school in 1998 with a 3.0 GPA and a scholarship to Georgia Perimeter College. He was expelled from college in 2001 after he was caught in possession of crack cocaine by an undercover police officer. He was sentenced to 90 days in county jail and probation.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After his first arrest, Mane began to take music seriously. He released an album called La Flare, distributed through a run of 1,000 CDs he distributed throughout East Atlanta. Mane did a collaboration with Young Jeezy called "So Icy," which was distributed through Tommy Boy Records. In 2005, Mane released his independent debut album entitled Trap House. The album crept into the Top 20 of the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and landed at the top spot on the Billboard Heatseekers Album chart. His second album Hard to Kill followed in 2006.

The murder charge against him was dropped in January 2006. The previous October, Mane had pleaded no contest on a charge of aggravated assault of a nightclub owner the previous summer. When the murder charge was dropped, Mane was serving a six-month sentence for the assault. He was released from jail in late January 2006. Mane served a year in prison for violating probation by not completing his community service hours on his 2005 assault conviction. He was released in May 2010.</p><p>Mane has been arrested and incarcerated a number of times since 2010. As of early 2023, he was most recently released from jail in 2016.</p><h2 id=previous-money-issues><strong>Previous Money Issues</strong></h2><p>In November 2013, Gucci Mane filed a lawsuit against his former manager <a href=#>Debra Antney</a> and her son, fellow rapper <a href=#>Waka Flocka Flame</a>. In the lawsuit, Gucci claims Debra and Waka robbed him blind while he was their client. Gucci claimed Debra stole jewelry and mismanaged his royalties and assets.

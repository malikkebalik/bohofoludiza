Only freedom from inconvenience. And to help a poor twisted goof get his life together.</strong>"</p><p>Argento responded to Bourdain's text about not buying silence by writing:</p><p>"<strong>I will never buy his silence for something that isn't true since I am also broke. I don't fear him. I am no Puritan, google my ass.</strong>"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZK60tcBmmKuflaPBsHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-old-is-baki-hanma.html>&#171;&nbsp;How old is Baki Hanma?</a>

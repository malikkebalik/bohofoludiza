Foxx’s father, Fred Sanford, left the family when he was just 4-years-old.</p><p id=par-5_27>Foxx’s character on Sanford and Son was named after his older brother who shared his father’s name, but the comedian’s given name was John Elroy Sanford.</p><p id=par-6_46>Foxx had an interesting childhood, going to school with the first Black mayor of Chicago, Harold Washington, and meeting Malcolm X, then known as Malcolm Little. In his autobiography, the late Civil Rights Leader mentioned the comedian saying, “Chicago Red, the funniest dishwasher on this earth.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_17>Foxx began his career in 1939 when he was just 17 on Major Bowes Amateur Hour&nbsp;radio.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-did-redd-foxx-die>How did Redd Foxx die?</h2><p id=par-8_55>Foxx died in 1991 at age 68. At the time, he was shooting a new sitcom titled, The Royal Family. During some downtime, Foxx was chatting with a reporter from&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight and was abruptly snatched up by a producer to rehearse with his co-star, Della Reese, though he had no lines in the scene.</p><p id=par-9_54>Foxx and the producer had a few words, but he eventually carried on with the rehearsal before collapsing on set and dying of a heart attack. At first, no one thought anything was wrong since Foxx’s character on Sandford and Son was known for faking heart attacks. However, the comedian was later pronounced dead.</p><p id=par-10_35>“It was an end so ironic that for a brief moment castmates figured Foxx–whose 1970s TV character often faked coronaries–was kidding when he grabbed a chair and fell to the floor,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> reported.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE044tb4BZg</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-was-redd-foxx-s-net-worth-when-he-died>What was Redd Foxx’s net worth when he died?</h2><p id=par-11_58>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Foxx was $3.5 million in debt due to his lavish lifestyle, a costly divorce in the 1970s, and money owed to the IRS. “Foxx reportedly once earned $4 million in a single year but depleted his fortune with a lavish lifestyle, exacerbated by what he called ‘very bad management,'”<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> People Magazine</a> reported.</p><p id=par-12_23>Still, despite the things that were lost during his life, Foxx’s genius and massive career lives on 30 years after his death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FprDDZp2osKhiu6bAjLCmq6yYY7W1ucto</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ironically-dilbert-is-actually-funny-now-that-it-s-been-turned-into-scott-adams-memes.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ironically, Dilbert is actually funny now that its been turned into Scott Adams memes</a>

Her mansion was located on S. Rockingham Avenue, a one minute drive from <a href=#>O.J. Simpson's</a> one-time Rockingham mansion. A month after Diller's death, her son listed the 1.2 acre property for sale for $12.6 million. Three months later, in December 2012, the mansion sold for $9.35 million.

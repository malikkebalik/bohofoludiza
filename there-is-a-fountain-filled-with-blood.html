Published in 1772<br></strong></p><img title="William Cowper" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebratingholidays.com/Pictures/hymns/cowper.jpg alt="William Cowper" width=200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><span><strong>Williams Cowper (1731-1800)</strong></span><p>William Cowper (pronounced Cooper) was born in England in 1731. His father, John C. Cowper, was a well-known pastor and served as a chaplain to George II. William’s mother, whom he loved dearly, died when he was only six-years-old. This tragedy may have led to the bouts of depression with which William struggled throughout his life.</p><p>As William grew, he excelled in many of his endeavors. He studied law at Westminster School where he was accomplished in his studies as well as in sports (particularly cricket and football). He was admitted to the bar (an associated of professional lawyers) in 1754. However, he never practiced law. Because William had a debilitating dread of public appearances, he turned his attention to writing and became known for his many humorous satires.</p><p>Around 1763, William was nominated to a prominent position in the House of Lords. However, when he found out that he had to appear before them (in order to determine his suitability for the office), his fear and anxiety led to a mental breakdown — so terrible was his mental state that he tried to commit suicide. Though his attempt was not successful, he remained in a deep depression for some time. William had struggles with periods of melancholy even in his school days, but this marked a turn into a more dark and sustained depression. Fortunately, William had some dear and patient Christian friends who cared for him until the depression passed.</p><p>In 1767, William became acquainted with John Newton (author of “Amazing Grace”), and he moved to the town of Olney to work with him. William spent many years in Olney, where he collaborated with Newton to produce the famous Olney Hymns (1779) — to which he contributed 67 works.1</p><p>William became a prolific writer and was considered by many to be the leading poet of his day.&nbsp; He added to his fame with a masterful translation of Homer in 1791, and even gained recognition for his letter-writing. Hymnologist John Julian writes, “the charm of his letters is unsurpassed.”2</p><p>Despite his fame, William struggled with bouts of depression throughout the remainder of his life, and he constantly battled a fear that he was doomed to everlasting punishment after death. Fortunately, William devoted his pen to writing the truth about God’s grace and mercy — for the benefit of his own soul, as well as the many who rejoiced in his hymns.</p><p>When William passed from this life in 1800, the famous poet, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, wrote:</p><p>“With quiet sadness and no gloom, I learn to think upon him,<br>With meekness that is gratefulness to God whose Heaven hath won him,<br>Who suffered once the madness-cloud to His own love to blind him,<br>But gently led the blind along where breath and bird could find him.”3</p><p>You can find the eulogy in its entirety at <a onclick='pageTracker._trackPageview("/outgoing/www.hymntime.com/tch/bio/c/o/w/cowper_w.htm")' href=#>Hymn Time</a>.</p><p>The hymn tune “Cleansing Fountain” has sometimes been attributed to the American musician Lowell Mason, but many scholars believe rather that the anonymous tune came from early American camp meeting songs.4</p><h3><strong>Lyrics for “There is a Fountain Filled with Blood”:</strong></h3><p>There is a fountain filled with blood<br>Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins;<br>And sinners plunged beneath that flood<br>Lose all their guilty stains.<br>Lose all their guilty stains,<br>Lose all their guilty stains;<br>And sinners plunged beneath that flood<br>Lose all their guilty stains.</p><p>The dying thief rejoiced to see<br>That fountain in his day;<br>And there have I, though vile as he,<br>Washed all my sins away.<br>Washed all my sins away,<br>Washed all my sins away;<br>And there have I, though vile as he,<br>Washed all my sins away.</p><p>Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood<br>Shall never lose its power<br>Till all the ransomed church of God<br>Be saved, to sin no more.<br>Be saved, to sin no more,<br>Be saved, to sin no more;<br>Till all the ransomed church of God<br>Be saved, to sin no more.</p><p>E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream<br>Thy flowing wounds supply,<br>Redeeming love has been my theme,<br>And shall be till I die.<br>And shall be till I die,<br>And shall be till I die;<br>Redeeming love has been my theme,<br>And shall be till I die.</p><p>Then in a nobler, sweeter song,<br>I’ll sing Thy power to save,<br>When this poor lisping, stammering tongue<br>Lies silent in the grave.<br>Lies silent in the grave,<br>Lies silent in the grave;<br>When this poor lisping, stammering tongue<br>Lies silent in the grave.</p><p>Lord, I believe Thou hast prepared,<br>Unworthy though I be,<br>For me a blood bought free reward,<br>A golden harp for me!<br>A golden harp for me,<br>A golden harp for me;<br>For me a blood bought free reward,<br>A golden harp for me!</p><p>’Tis strung and tuned for endless years,<br>And formed by power divine,<br>To sound in God the Father’s ears<br>No other name but Thine;<br>No other name but Thine,<br>No other name but Thine;<br>To sound in God the Father’s ears<br>No other name but Thine.</p><h3><strong>Additional Resources for “There is a Fountain Filled with Blood”:</strong></h3><p><a onclick='pageTracker._trackPageview("/outgoing/www.hymnary.org/media/fetch/98112")' href=#>Sheet Music</a> (PDF Compliments of Hymnary.org)</p><p><a onclick='pageTracker._trackPageview("/outgoing/tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/w/william_cowper/there_is_a_fountain_crd.htm")' href=#>Guitar Chords</a> (Links to Ultimate Guitar)</p><p>Visit <a onclick='pageTracker._trackPageview("/outgoing/www.hymnary.org/text/there_is_a_fountain_filled_with_blood_dr")' href=#>Hymnary.org</a> or <a onclick='pageTracker._trackPageview("/outgoing/www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/t/f/o/tfountfb.htm")' href=#>Hymn Time.com</a> for more on this hymn.</p><p>See our <a href=#>Hymn of the Week</a> page for a list of the hymns that are included on this site.</p><p>This page was created by:</p><p><img title="angie signature" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebratingholidays.com/Pictures/misc/angiesigpng.png alt="angie signature" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><span>We welcome your ideas!

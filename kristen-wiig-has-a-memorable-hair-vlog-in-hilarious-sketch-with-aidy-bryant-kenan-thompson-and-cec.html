Last year on May 9, 2020, a sketch called “Hair Vlog” was played out remotely during season 45, episode 18 of SNL At Home where the cast members and actors performed from their homes. Despite the remote sketch, <a href=#>SNL</a> still manages to make us laugh in new situations.</p><p id=par-2_22>Kristen Wiig took part in the hilarious sketch about hair, and it’s a must-see with big names taking part along with her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kristen-wiig-has-a-memorable-hair-vlog>Kristen Wiig has a memorable hair vlog</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kristen-Wiig.jpg><p id=par-3_104>During the episode, Kristen Wiig, an actor who worked on&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;for a number of years, hosts. She stars in “Hair Vlog,” where she plays PJ Charnt. Her vlog, called “Bouncy Waves,” is full of hair, to put it mildly. Wiig’s character, PJ, has her voluminous brown locks flowing everywhere as she looks down at the camera, which is pointed upward so the hair takes up a good portion of the view most of the time that she’s in the shot. She flips her hair around with her bouncy locks as she talks, making it quite the spectacle the entire time she’s seen on camera.</p><p id=par-4_48>“Hey, it’s me, PJ Charnt,” PJ says. “This is my hair vlog, where I answer questions and give hair advice, and just inspire you with the beautiful hair that I have. Look at it,” she says as she moves it around. She’s clearly obsessed with her own hair.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pj-tries-to-help-aidy-bryant-s-character-with-her-hair-dilemma>PJ tries to help Aidy Bryant’s character with her hair dilemma</h2><p id=par-5_43>PJ, who’s quite animated with her hair the entire time she’s speaking, gets a video call from a viewer named Nell, played by Aidy Bryant, from Tucson, Arizona. Her hair appears quite flat and greasy, which is the point of her call.</p><p id=par-6_56>“I’m sorry, I’m just so excited to meet you,” Nell says. “I watch your vlog all the time on the toilet.” She goes on to talk about her hair problems. “I don’t know if you can tell, my hair is very flat, and it’s kind of greasy, and I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_58>PJ asks about her “daily regimen,” to which Nell explains that she washes it every day and doesn’t use a lot of conditioner. As she’s talking, PJ continues moving her head around as she listens, getting it all in the camera. Nell explains that she blow-dries with a round brush. Adding, “And then I style it with margarine.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_10>“Wait, what size round brush are you using?” PJ inquires.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_50>“I knew it,” Nell says. “My round brush needs a bigger circumference.” PJ agrees as she throws her hair around telling Nell to “check in” with her the following week. But before leaving, Nell admits that she wishes she could have hair like PJ’s, to which she replies, “You won’t.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kenan-thompson-s-character-has-a-question-about-his-locks>Kenan Thompson’s character has a question about his locks</h2><p id=par-10_43>The next video call question comes from Kenan Thompson, who plays Christy from Tucson, Arizona, who has a mullet. He has an important job interview over Zoom as a house painter, and he says it’s to “paint the exterior of Caesar’s Palace.”</p><p id=par-11_16>“And I want to look my best, but I can’t get my normal blowout,” he says.</p><p id=par-12_16>“You’re in a pickle,” PJ says while moving around her hair as she’s known to do.</p><p id=par-13_13>“I am in a jar of pickles,” he says. “Help me PJ Charnt.”</p><p id=par-14_26>PJ seems to have the answer. “Christie, do you have a car with a sunroof, a can of quick-hold hairspray, a large-tooth comb, and long legs?”</p><p id=par-15_28>Christie calls PJ a “genius,” and says he knows “exactly what to do.” He holds up his keys and turns a blow dryer on as he says goodbye.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pj-gets-hair-gifs-from-her-friend-patty-played-by-cecily-strong>PJ gets hair gifs from her friend Patty, played by Cecily Strong</h2><p id=par-16_87>That’s not all that happens though. During the video, PJ continues with her locks in the camera view as she shows off some gifs that she received from her friend, Patty, played by Cecily Strong, who has identical voluminous hair, except hers is blonde. The gifs are of course about hair. One says, “Girls Be Like… My Hair Ain’t Damaged,” with Beetlejuice included and his hair sticking out all over his head. They both laugh hysterically at the gif while moving around their hair as they laugh.</p><p id=par-17_48>But the second gif PJ doesn’t find funny as it’s a girl with spaghetti for hair getting blow-dried. Patty laughs and moves her hair around, saying, “What do you think? He’s blow-drying her hair, but her hair is spaghetti.” She continues to laugh, but PJ isn’t feeling it.</p><p id=par-18_37>“I, I know what it is, and I don’t find it funny,” she reponds. PJ actually stops moving her hair during the conversation. “Pasta is hair isn’t funny,” she continues. “Only hair should always only be hair.”</p><p id=par-19_62>She even goes so far as to tell her friend that she doesn’t want to talk to her for a while. She then tells the viewers watching at home to “tune in next week,” as she flips her hair around while saying, “And if you wanna have hair like mine, you never will. But I’m sure you have other stuff going on.”</p><p id=par-20_22>It’s probably the most hilarious sketch we’ve seen about hair, and it has a number of big names included in it too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAosDUq5uasV2jtqi002ajoq6VYriztdKtnKdlp562qHnMnqSoqpGXuaZ5x5qgq2WmobyoesetpKVn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./pokefans-are-convinced-that-cyclizar-must-have-legendary-origins.html>&#171;&nbsp;Pokefans are convinced that Cyclizar must have legendary origins</a>

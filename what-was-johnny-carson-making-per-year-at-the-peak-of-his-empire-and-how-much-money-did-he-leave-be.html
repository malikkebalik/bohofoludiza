He hosted </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Tonight Show </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>for 30 years from 1962 to 1992, turning it into one of the most-watched programs on television. The show helped break major comedians like <a href=# title="Jerry Seinfeld Net Worth">Jerry Seinfeld</a> and <a href=# title="Drew Carey Net Worth">Drew Carey</a> and served as an inspiration to future late show hosts, including <a href=# title="David Letterman Net Worth">David Letterman</a>, <a href=# title="Jay Leno Net Worth">Jay Leno</a>, Conan O'Brien, and <a href=# title="Jimmy Fallon Net Worth">Jimmy Fallon</a>. Throughout the run of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Tonight Show</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Carson won six Emmys, a Peabody, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom. At its peak, the show was averaging 11 million viewers every single night.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That success proved quite lucrative to Carson. While he entertained millions, he was also racking up millions. Beyond that, he left a significant amount of money to charity when he died in 2005.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><strong>But just how much did Carson make during his peak?</strong></span></p><p><strong>And how much money did he leave behind?</strong></p><p>Spoiler: The answer to both questions is "a lot."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-332449 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-74256521.jpg alt width=900 height=612 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-332449 class=wp-caption-text>Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</p><h2><span style=font-weight:400><strong>Early Career</strong></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>What's most impressive about Carson's success is that he started in radio, not television. He served in the Navy during World War II and graduated from the University of Nebraska upon his return, earning his degree in radio and speech. Carson quickly grew his local fan base at an Omaha radio station before moving to Los Angeles in 1951 to pursue bigger things.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In LA, Carson started a show called Carson's Cellar, which again quickly exploded in popularity. Carson caught the attention of <a href=# title="Red Skelton Net Worth">Red Skelton</a>, who hired him to work on his TV show. From 1954 to 1962, Carson was the host of multiple television programs and panel game shows, including </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>To Tell the Truth</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Who Do You Trust</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Earn Your Vacation</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. At the beginning of 1962, Jack Paar announced he was leaving </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Tonight Show</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. NBC executives asked Carson to take Paar's place.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And Carson said no.</span></p><h2><strong>The Tonight Show</strong></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>He was nervous about one element of the show: interviewing celebrities. He had never done it before and thought he wouldn't be any good at it. NBC spent months looking for a replacement, but found little success and returned to Carson.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This time, Carson said yes. His first show aired on October 1, 1962, and was an instant hit with audiences. It soon became NBC's most popular program, and by 1975 it was earning the network $60 million in revenue every year ($330 million when adjusted for inflation). At that point Johnny Carson was earning $4 million annually (around $22 million today). But he was about to make a move that would earn him even more money.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 1980, Carson agreed to deal with NBC that would give his company, Carson Productions, ownership of both </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Tonight Show </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Late Night with David Letterman</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, which ran on NBC from 1980 to 1992.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>By 1991, Carson was making <strong>$25 million</strong> per year. That's the same as making <span style=color:red><strong>$55 million</strong></span> per year today!</span></p><h2><strong>John W. Carson Foundation</strong></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Carson didn't spend all of his money, though. Throughout his life, he donated an incredible amount to charity and educational institutions, and he did it all without the spotlight on him.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 1981, Carson established the John W. Carson Foundation, also known as the Johnny Carson Foundation. He donated $5.3 million to his alma mater, the University of Nebraska, in 2004, following that up with another $6 million donation after his death. The university renamed its performing arts department in his honor; it's now called the Johnny Carson School of Theater and Film.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Through his foundation, Carson donated at least $1 to $2 million annually, largely to nonprofits and educational organizations in Nebraska and Los Angeles.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Upon his death in 2005 at age 79, <a href=# rel=noopener>Carson's estate gifted a trust to his foundation</a> to start an academic program and educational facility focused on emerging media. The gift was listed at $20 million, but it turned out to be worth much more than that.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The full value of the trust was revealed five years later in an IRS tax return â a whopping <span style=color:red><strong>$156 million</strong></span>. Today, the value of the trust has surpassed $200 million. If that weren't enough, Carson also left $4 million to Los Angeles Children's Hospital.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Carson delighted audiences across the world for more than four decades. Even after his death, he's still making sure people are happy.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJorqGZpGLEor%2BMo6ahpp6ueqSt0aymp2WdlriqusZmp56qXa6yor6MmqtmrJiaerGxwKRkqJ5dnba0ecSmp6KqlWKur7CMoaawZZ2qsKl5zKilnrFdmbaleceeZKWdkauybq7EoaCnnF8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-andy-griffith-was-buried-4-hours-after-his-death.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Andy Griffith Was Buried 4 Hours After His Death</a>

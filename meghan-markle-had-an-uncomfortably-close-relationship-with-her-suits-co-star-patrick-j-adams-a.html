Long before Meghan married into the royal family, her relationship with Adams made some of her close friends “uncomfortable.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Meghan-Markle-Suits.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-inside-meghan-markle-s-steamy-on-screen-romance>Inside Meghan Markle’s steamy on-screen romance</h2><p id=par-2_41>Prior to her wedding to Prince Harry in 2018, Meghan enjoyed a successful run on the popular legal drama Suits. The Duchess of Sussex played Rachel Zane on the show, who was romantically involved with Patrick J Adams’ Mike Ross.</p><p id=par-3_47>Fans immediately picked up on the chemistry between Meghan and Adams, and experts believe producers were “thrilled” that casting Meghan worked out. According to <a href=#>Express</a>, royal expert Andrew Morton explained how Meghan and Adams’s chemistry was one of the driving forces behind the show’s early success.</p><p id=par-4_63>“Cast, crew and the money men at the network were ecstatic, the producers thrilled that their gamble to cast Meghan opposite Patrick had paid off big time, the show’s fans buzzing about the couple’s on-screen chemistry,” Morton shared. “Their off-screen chemistry was equally noticeable, almost uncomfortably so, according to guests at Meghan and Trevor [Engelson]’s wedding, which took place in Jamaica in 2011.”</p><p id=par-5_49>While fans loved watching Meghan Markle and Patrick Adams interact on the series, their chemistry outside of work was also getting attention. In fact, Morton revealed that the two had a strong “bond” off the set, mostly because they spent so much time working together on the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-patrick-j-adams-opens-up-about-his-relationship-with-meghan-markle>Patrick J. Adams opens up about his relationship with Meghan Markle</h2><p id=par-6_29>A few years before Suits, Patrick J. Adams started dating his Equivocation co-star, Troian Bellisario. After experiencing some ups and downs, the pair tied the knot in 2016.</p><p id=par-7_46>Meghan and Engelson, meanwhile, parted ways in 2013. She started dating Harry a few years later and they exchanged vows in the spring of 2018. Adams and Bellisario were invited to the wedding and attended the lavish ceremony, which was held inside St. George’s Chapel.</p><p id=par-8_46>Once things heated up between <a href=#>Meghan and Harry</a>, the actor decided to leave the series for a new life with the royal family. With his on-screen romance gone, Adams left the series as well, though he did return for a brief appearance in season 9.</p><p id=par-9_41>In speaking about their relationship outside of the show, Adams revealed that they developed a close bond because they shared so many scenes together. He also noted that they were both cast as young actors and basically “grew up together.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_36>“In some ways, Meghan and I were the closest because we were the youngest people in the cast and both came in with the least experience,” he explained. “We grew up together over the course of the show.”</p><p id=par-11_43>Meghan Markle, of course, had more than one friend on the set of Suits. She was close with most of her co-stars, including Gina Torres, Gabriel Macht, Sarah Rafferty, Abigail Spencer, and Rick Hoffman, all of whom made it to her wedding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-was-patrick-adams-forced-to-delete-his-instagram-because-of-meghan-markle>Was Patrick Adams forced to delete his Instagram because of Meghan Markle?</h2><p id=par-12_30>While it is clear that Adams and Meghan shared a close connection, he was forced to delete his Instagram account after sharing a questionable photo of himself and Meghan.</p><p id=par-13_45>The image was a throwback pic of Meghan Markle giving Adams a kiss on the cheek and was taken during one of the first episodes they worked together. Unfortunately, Adams shared the photo while Meghan was getting ready to tie the knot with Harry.</p><p id=par-14_28>“I went to bed, and woke up in the morning and realized ‘Oh, yeah. I live in a world where you can’t post things about Meghan,’” he admitted.</p><p id=par-15_48>Adams went on to assure fans that the kiss was perfectly innocent and that nothing romantic had ever happened between him and Meghan. He even went as far as to say that he views Meghan as a sister, which explains why they share such a tight bond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6prPHmqVmpZGnuK2xjKGYnWWRo3q2usKopJ%2Bnoqmuo7jYZpqlp6OaerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIywoK2gXZ2ys3nSrqCtq12YvG6%2F05qpZqiRqb%2Bqr8pmoWaZlJa6tHnAnJqoqpSeu6h506hksJ2Umbavs4ygrJ6rpKh7qcDMpWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jimmy-page-reveals-the-clothes-that-survived-his-led-zeppelin-days.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jimmy Page Reveals the Clothes That Survived His Led Zeppelin Days</a>

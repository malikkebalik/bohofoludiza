Obama is an American politician who has a net worth of $70 million. That is a combined net worth with his wife <a href=#>Michelle Obama</a>. The Obamas were not wealthy for much of their adult lives. They first became millionaires in roughly 2005 thanks to book royalties as Barack entered the political spotlight. He is a former Senator from Illinois and the 44th President of the United States. Barack Obama served one term in the Illinois Senate and is the first African American President of the United States.</p><p>Before entering politics, Obama graduated from Harvard Law School, where he served as the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School.</p><p>His political career began in the Illinois State Senate, where he served from 1997 to 2004. During his time in the state legislature, he worked on legislation related to healthcare, education, and ethics reform. His keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention catapulted him into the national spotlight, setting the stage for his election to the U.S. Senate later that year.</p><p>In the U.S. Senate, Obama continued to focus on issues such as transparency in government, nuclear non-proliferation, and veterans' care. His engaging speaking style and calls for bipartisan cooperation resonated with many Americans, laying the groundwork for his presidential campaign.</p><p>Obama's 2008 presidential campaign was groundbreaking, utilizing social media and grassroots organizing in innovative ways. His victory made him the first African American President of the United States. During his presidency, Obama's administration faced significant challenges, including the economic recession and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.</p><p>Domestically, he prioritized healthcare reform, resulting in the passage of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. His administration also made strides in areas such as renewable energy, financial regulation, and LGBTQ rights.</p><p>In foreign policy, Obama focused on rebuilding America's image abroad, ending the Iraq War, and ordering the operation that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden. The administration also played a key role in international agreements such as the Iran Nuclear Deal and the Paris Climate Agreement.</p><p>After leaving the White House, Obama has remained active in public life, focusing on initiatives related to education, civic engagement, and leadership development through the Obama Foundation. He has also authored several books, including his presidential memoir, "A Promised Land."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-152988 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Barack-Obama.jpg alt width=594 height=437 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-152988 class=wp-caption-text>(SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Barack Hussein Obama II was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. He is the only US President to date who was born outside of the contiguous 48 states.</p><p>His mother was Ann Dunham was of English, German, Swiss, Scottish, Irish and Welsh descent.

Barack was lived in Indonesia until 1971 when he moved back to Honolulu to live with his mother's parents. He attended high school here, graduating in 1979. Ann and Lolo stayed married until 1980.

The majority of the Obama family income during this time came from Michelle's lucrative salary as a lawyer working primarily for the University of Chicago hospital system.</p><p>In 2005 Barack's income jumped to $157,100 when he became a US Senator. In the same year, Michelle earned $273,618. In 2005, their total income was $1.65 million. Where did that extra $1.2 million come from???â€¦</p><p>Barack wrote his first book "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance" in 1995. It was not particularly popular for the first 8 or 9 years after being released. After his 2004 DNC keynote, the book exploded in popularity, leading to a significant royalty windfall for the Obama family that showed up as income in 2005.</p><p>In 2006 the Obamas reported income of $916,000. Barack's second book "Audacity of Hope", released in October 2006, was a massive hit, selling millions of copies and rocketing the Obama's income to $4.2 million in 2007. Their income continued to swell in the following years thanks to Barack's 2008 successful campaign and election. To this day, Barack Obama earns $3.75 for every hardcover copy and $1.12 for every paperback he sells. Royalties remained healthy in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Obama released "Of Thee I Sing" in November 2010 and "A Promised Land" in November 2020.</p><p>In February 2017, Barack and Michelle Obama received a $60 million advance for the combined rights to their autobiographies.</p><h2 id=income-history><strong>Income History</strong></h2><p>Below you will find a table listing a complete 15-year history of the income Barack and Michelle earned between 2000 and 2017. They stopped releasing their tax releases after 2015. We don't know exactly how much they earned in 2016 or 2017. In 2017 we do know that the Obamas received a $65 million book advance for multiple books and media projects.</p><p>After leaving the White House they have made even more money from book advances and are now both highly sought-after public speakers. Reportedly, during a trip to Australia in March 2023 in which he met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Obama was paid more than $1 million for two speeches.</p><table style=height:744px width=365><tbody><tr><td colspan=2 width=193><strong>The Obama Family Income History</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Income</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>$240,000</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>$272,759</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>$259,394</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>$238,327</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>$207,647</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>$1,655,106</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>$983,826</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>$4,139,965</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>$2,656,902</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>$5,505,409</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>$1,728,096</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>$789,674</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>$662,076</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>$481,098</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>$477,383</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>$436,065</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>$400,000</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>At least $65,000,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><strong>$86,133,727</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href=#>How much does the president make?</a>&nbsp;As President, Barack Obama's base salary was&nbsp;$400,000 a year.

The Obama home is 6,400 square feet with six bedrooms, six bathrooms, mahogany bookshelves, a granite kitchen floor, and wine cellar:</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-262405 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/obam.jpg alt="Barack Obama Chicago House" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-262405 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><p>Upon leaving office, Barack and Michelle rented a mansion in Washington D.C. while their youngest daughter finished high school. In June 2017, they spent $8.1 million to buy the 8,200 square-foot rental.</p><h2 id=martha8217s-vineyard-property><strong>Martha's Vineyard Property</strong></h2><p>In 2019, the Obamas paid $11.75 million for a house on Martha's Vineyard. The property has a 7,000 square-foot main home and 29 oceanfront acres of land. The seller of the property was Boston Celtics owner <a href=#>Wyc Grousbeck</a>.</p><p>Here's how the home's official listing described it:</p><p><strong>"The spacious and dramatic living room space boasts vaulted ceilings with exposed steel beams and a focal point stone fireplace. There are two guest wings and an impressive master suite with fireplace, private sun deck and spectacular water views. Your summer days can be spent poolside in a garden-like setting with the sounds of the waves lapping in the distance, or exploring the expansive Great Pond and outer barrier beach for a full day on the water. A property of this stature needs to be seen to be experienced."</strong></p><p>The house has not just one, but two guest wings, interestingly, though, only a two-car garage, which means that any long-term guests (like, for example,&nbsp;Sasha&nbsp;and&nbsp;Malia) will have to find someplace else to park. It does, however, have plenty of private beachfront including a boathouse.</p><p>The Obamas are reported to have already been renting the property as a summer home, and evidently they've loved their time there enough to make an offer to buy the house.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6sbvLoquim5mWu7R7z6ucrKGUmru1v46bmKuZk6B6sK7ApphmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bill-daily-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bill Daily Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
